Q1:
The program does the following operations:
1. creates a directory called "welcome_dir_1" under the current working directory, with full access for all users
(read, write, execute).
2. creates a sub-directory called "welcome_dir_2" under "welcome_dir_1", with full access for all users
(read, write, execute).
3. Allocates memory for the program's data segment and expands it according to the program's memory consumption.
4. Creates a file called "welcome_file.txt" under "welcome_dir_2" and opens it with write only permissions
5. Opens the /etc/localtime system file with read only permissions,
reads the file, reads again the last few bytes from the file and then closes it.
6. writes the string "welcome to OS-2023" to the file "welcome_file.txt" and closes it
7. removes the file "welcome_file.txt"
8. attempts to remove the directories "welcome_dir_1" and "welcome_dir_2" using unlink (which doesn't work on
directories)
9. successfully removes the directories "welcome_dir_1" and "welcome_dir_2" using rmdir
10. closes all the threads of the process and exits with status 0
